# Aitri Integration Contract — Changelog

Changes to the `.aitri` schema or artifact schemas that affect subproduct readers.
Subproducts should check this file when upgrading their Aitri reader implementation.

---

## v0.1.66

**New artifact: `BUGS.json`**
- New optional artifact in `<artifactsDir>/BUGS.json` (same dir as `spec/`).
- Written by `aitri bug add` (manual) or prompted by `aitri verify-run` on test failure.
- Schema: `id, title, description, steps_to_reproduce[], expected_result, actual_result, environment, severity, status, fr, tc_reference, phase_detected, detected_by, evidence, reported_by, created_at, updated_at, resolution`
- Lifecycle: `open → fixed → verified → closed`
- Blocking rule: `status=open` + `severity=critical|high` → blocks `verify-complete`
- Playwright integration: `evidence` auto-populated from `test-results/` on test failure
- Subproducts can read `BUGS.json` directly — not registered in `.aitri` state

**New commands (no `.aitri` schema change):**
- `aitri review` — cross-artifact semantic consistency check (req→TC, TC→results)
- `aitri bug` — full bug lifecycle with `add`, `fix`, `verify`, `close`, `list`
- `adopt verify-spec` — brownfield TC stub generator for existing codebases

**`verify-run` behavior change:**
- On test failure with TTY: prompts `Register as bugs? [y/N]` — auto-populates from runner output
- Playwright failures: `detected_by: "playwright"`, `evidence` from `test-results/` if available
- `autoVerifyBugs`: transitions `fixed → verified` when linked TC passes

**`.aitri` schema:** no new fields in v0.1.66.

## v0.1.64

**Breaking for subproducts relying on Aitri auto-registration:**
- `aitri init` and `aitri adopt --upgrade` no longer write to `~/.aitri-hub/projects.json`.
- Hub and other subproducts must manage their own project registries independently.
- Existing `~/.aitri-hub/projects.json` entries are unaffected; only new project creation stops auto-registering.

**New documentation:**
- `docs/integrations/` directory introduced as canonical integration contract.
- `docs/integrations/README.md` — integration model overview.
- `docs/integrations/SCHEMA.md` — consolidates and supersedes `docs/HUB_INTEGRATION.md`.
- `docs/integrations/ARTIFACTS.md` — artifact schemas including node hierarchy for graph consumers.
- `docs/integrations/CHANGELOG.md` — this file.
- `docs/HUB_INTEGRATION.md` — removed. Content migrated to `docs/integrations/SCHEMA.md`.

---

## v0.1.63

- `complete` now updates `artifactHashes` (previously only `approve` did).
  Hash check returns `false` after successful `complete` — no drift until next modification.
- `aitriVersion` field formalized. Version mismatch detection pattern documented.
- `verifyPassed`, `verifySummary`, `rejections` fields formally added to schema.
- Event schema updated: `"started"` added as valid event type; `afterDrift` on `"approved"` events.
- Feature sub-pipelines (`features/<name>/`) documented.

## v0.1.58

- `driftPhases[]` field added. Written by `run-phase` on drift; cleared by `complete`/`approve`.
- Subproducts can use `driftPhases[]` as fast path for drift detection.
- `driftPhases[]` may be absent in projects created before v0.1.58 — fall back to hash check.

## v0.1.51

- Document initial. Fields `artifactHashes`, `events`, `artifactsDir` formalized.
- Drift detection via hash comparison documented.
- Hub integration contract established.

## v0.1.46

- `aitri init` began auto-registering projects in Hub (removed in v0.1.64).

## v0.1.45

- `events[]` field added to schema (pipeline activity log).
