# Aitri Integration Contract — Changelog

Changes to the `.aitri` schema or artifact schemas that affect subproduct readers.
Subproducts should check this file when upgrading their Aitri reader implementation.

---

## v0.1.90 (2026-04-23) — Brownfield integrity + audit trail — additive

**`03_TEST_CASES.json` — alternative multi-FR shape**
- `test_cases[].frs: string[]` is now recognized as an alternative to `requirement_id: string`. When both are present, `frs` wins. Canonical single-FR shape is still `requirement_id`.
- Additive. No existing field removed, no type changed. Readers that only consume `requirement_id` keep working for single-FR TCs.

**`verify-run` schema precondition**
- New preflight check: if `test_cases[]` is non-empty and no entry exposes `requirement_id` or `frs`, `aitri verify-run` exits with an error before running the test command and before writing `04_TEST_RESULTS.json`. Behavior change only for projects adopted under the legacy v0.1.x schema (`requirement` string).
- **Subproduct impact:** `04_TEST_RESULTS.json` on legacy projects will no longer be overwritten with an all-zeros `fr_coverage`. If a Hub view previously displayed a degraded coverage block for such projects, the stale state on disk will now persist until the project migrates. Migration is manual: rename `requirement` → `requirement_id` on each test case, or use `frs: ["FR-001","FR-002"]` for multi-FR TCs.

**`01_REQUIREMENTS.json` — NFR legacy field tolerance (read-side only)**
- `aitri status --json`, `aitri resume`, and `buildProjectSnapshot()` now surface `openNFRs[].category ?? nfr.title` and `openNFRs[].requirement ?? nfr.constraint`. Reader accommodation only — Phase 1's `validate()` still enforces the canonical `{category, requirement}` fields on new artifacts.
- **Subproduct impact:** none. Hub reads `openNFRs` as produced by the snapshot, which now normalizes the shape.

**`BUGS.json` — audit-trail fields (additive)**
- New optional fields on each bug entry:
  - `fix_commit_sha: string` — git HEAD at the moment of `aitri bug fix`
  - `fix_at: ISO8601` — timestamp paired with `fix_commit_sha`
  - `close_commit_sha: string` — git HEAD at the moment of `aitri bug close`
  - `close_at: ISO8601` — timestamp paired with `close_commit_sha`
  - `files_changed: string[]` — `git diff --name-only fix_commit_sha..close_commit_sha`, filtered to exclude `spec/` and `.aitri`
- All captured automatically when the project is a git repo. In non-git projects the fields are simply absent; the bug lifecycle still works.
- **Subproduct impact:** additive. Consumers that ignored unknown fields continue to work. Hub or future dashboards can now show a per-bug commit-range link and the list of files modified to resolve it.

**`aitri normalize --init`**
- New escape hatch for projects whose Phase 4 was approved before v0.1.80 (when `normalizeState` was introduced). Stamps a baseline at the current state. Refuses to run if Phase 4 is not approved, or if a `normalizeState` already exists (no silent clobber).
- **Subproduct impact:** none on read side. Hub already reads `normalizeState` as-is.

**`aitri validate` — deploy-files output**
- No longer labels `Dockerfile`/`docker-compose.yml` as "required"; warnings like `⚠️ Dockerfile — not found (check Phase 5 output)` are removed. The `validate` output lists existing deploy files and, when none exist, prints a neutral hint about non-containerized targets.
- **Subproduct impact:** the `--json` `deployFiles` shape (`{Dockerfile: bool, "docker-compose.yml": bool, "DEPLOYMENT.md": bool, ".env.example": bool}`) is preserved byte-for-byte. Consumers depending on this shape are unaffected.

**Integration-doc header bump**
- `SCHEMA.md`, `README.md`, `ARTIFACTS.md`, `STATUS_JSON.md` now declare `v0.1.90+`. Enforced by `test/release-sync.test.js`.

---

## v0.1.89 (2026-04-22) — Phase 1 SSoT model — additive

**IDEA.md role formalized as seed-only**
- First Phase 1 run reads `IDEA.md` (the seed brief). After `aitri approve 1` (first time), `IDEA.md` content is absorbed into `01_REQUIREMENTS.json.original_brief` (new optional field) and the `IDEA.md` file is removed from disk.
- All subsequent Phase 1 re-runs use `01_REQUIREMENTS.json` as the SSoT input. The agent refines current FRs instead of regenerating from a stale brief — this closes a real drift class where re-runs silently pruned legitimate FRs that grew organically past the original brief.
- Same pattern for feature sub-pipelines: `aitri feature run-phase <name> 1` materializes `FEATURE_IDEA.md → IDEA.md` only when the feature has no `01_REQUIREMENTS.json` yet.

**New artifact field: `01_REQUIREMENTS.json.original_brief`**
- Type: `string` (full IDEA.md content, verbatim).
- Optional and additive — old readers ignoring unknown fields keep working.
- Historical reference only. Aitri does not read this field for any behavioral decision; it exists for human recovery and future audit tooling.
- Present after first `aitri approve 1` if `IDEA.md` existed at that moment. Absent if the project was approved before v0.1.89 OR if `IDEA.md` was deleted manually before approval.

**Subproduct impact:**
- **Additive.** No schema field removed, no type changed. Hub and other readers need no changes.
- Hub may optionally surface `original_brief` in project detail views (e.g. "Original brief" expandable block).
- The disappearance of `IDEA.md` from disk after first Phase 1 approve is intentional, not a bug. Readers that previously checked `IDEA.md` existence to gauge project maturity should switch to checking `01_REQUIREMENTS.json` (more reliable signal).
- Compliance with the artifacts-as-SSoT invariant: Phase 1's behavior on re-runs now matches the same "current artifact = SSoT" model that Phases 2-5 already follow.

---

## v0.1.87 (2026-04-22) — deploy gate — additive

**New deploy-gate reason: `feature_verify_failed`**
- `computeHealth()` now blocks `deployable` when a feature sub-pipeline at phases 5/5 has `verify.ran && !verify.passed`. WIP features (phases < 5/5) remain independent — a feature still in development must not block root deploy.
- New reason object shape: `{ type: 'feature_verify_failed', message: string, features: string[] }` — `features` lists the offending feature names. Present alongside (not replacing) existing reasons.
- Surfaced via `aitri validate`, `aitri validate --explain`, `aitri validate --json.deployableReasons`, and `aitri status --json.health.deployableReasons`.

**Subproduct impact:**
- **Additive.** Old readers ignoring unknown reason types keep working. No field removed, no type change.
- Readers that enumerate `deployableReasons` should handle `feature_verify_failed` and optionally use its `features[]` field for richer UI. The existing `{ type, message }` contract is preserved — any reader that only formats `message` needs no changes.
- `v0.1.87` also updates `aitri validate` text output to enumerate features + Σ aggregate (shipped in v0.1.86, schema-free rendering-only change).

---

## v0.1.85 (2026-04-22) — bugfix (no schema change)

**Test-output parsers now handle multi-segment TC IDs**
- `parseRunnerOutput`, `parseVitestOutput`, `parsePytestOutput`, `parsePlaywrightOutput` previously truncated IDs like `TC-FE-001h` to `TC-FE`, causing every namespaced automated test to fall silently into `skipped_no_marker`.
- All four parsers now extract the full ID via the new shared `extractTCId()` helper. Single-segment IDs (`TC-001h`, `TC-020b`) unchanged.

**Subproduct impact:**
- None. No schema change. `04_TEST_RESULTS.json` shape, `.aitri.verifySummary`, `status --json.tests` all unchanged.
- Consumer projects with namespaced TC IDs that hit `skipped_no_marker` counts in prior versions should re-run `verify-run` + `verify-complete` per feature to get honest numbers. `.aitri.verifyPassed` persists across verify-runs until `verify-complete` re-runs.

---

## v0.1.84 — addendum (doc correction, no behavior change)

**ARTIFACTS.md sync with code — closing pre-existing drift (2026-04-21)**
- Phase 2 required sections now list 9 (added `Technical Risk Flags`, matching `phase2.js` validate()). Minimum length corrected from 30 to 40 lines.
- Phase 3 `edge_case` clarified as encouraged but not enforced — only `happy_path` and `negative` are strictly required per FR.
- Headers note added: Phase 2 accepts `## Name`, `## 1. Name`, or `## 1.1 Name` prefixes.

**Subproduct impact:**
- No schema change. This is a doc-accuracy correction; the runtime gates have been stricter than the doc claimed since before v0.1.84.
- Subproducts that relied on the doc when deciding whether a Phase 2 artifact "looks complete" should add the `Technical Risk Flags` section to any local heuristic.

---

## v0.1.84

**`aitri normalize --resolve` — maintenance-path closure for normalize cycle (behavior change, not schema change)**
- New flag on existing `aitri normalize` command. Closes the pending state without re-approving Phase 4 (which would cascade-invalidate Phase 5). Intended for maintenance changes classified as `refactor` or already-registered+verified `bug-fix` — i.e. code changes that did not require spec updates.
- Mechanical gates before closure: `verifyPassed === true`, no open critical/high bugs in `BUGS.json`. A non-TTY invocation is rejected when files are detected; with zero detected files the baseline auto-advances.
- Human TTY gate: prints the detected file list and requires explicit `y/N` confirmation that every file is `refactor` or registered `bug-fix`. `fr-change` / `new-feature` / `undetermined` entries must still route through the pipeline.
- Writes `normalize-resolved` event into `.aitri.events[]` with `{ files, method, baseRefFrom, baseRefTo }`.

**Subproduct impact:**
- **Schema unchanged** — `.aitri.normalizeState` shape is identical (`{ status, baseRef, method, lastRun }`). Readers do not need updates.
- **New event type** — `events[]` may now contain entries with `event: 'normalize-resolved'`. Readers that enumerate events should add this to any allow-list.
- **Observable change** — `normalizeState.status` can transition from `pending` → `resolved` without a `approved` phase-4 event preceding it. Consumers that inferred "normalize resolved ⇒ phase 4 re-approved" must drop that assumption.
- **Bump `INTEGRATION_LAST_REVIEWED`** to `0.1.84` after reviewing.

---

## v0.1.82

**Phase 1 validation — stricter semantic checks on requirements (behavior change, not schema change)**
- MUST FRs with a fully-vague title (e.g. `"La app debe funcionar correctamente"`, `"System must work properly"`) now fail `aitri complete 1`. Rule: title matches `BROAD_VAGUE` regex AND has <2 substantive tokens after stopword/vague-word removal. Bilingual EN/ES vocabulary.
- Pairs of FRs (any priority) with ≥3 acceptance_criteria each and ≥90% Jaccard similarity on normalized AC sets now fail validation. Detects copy-paste across FRs.
- `BROAD_VAGUE` regex extended to cover Spanish qualifiers (`correctamente`, `adecuadamente`, `eficientemente`, etc.).

**Subproduct impact:**
- **Schema unchanged** — `01_REQUIREMENTS.json` shape is identical. Readers that parse the artifact do not need updates.
- **Constraint tightened** — existing projects whose requirements have vague titles or duplicated ACs will fail the phase gate after upgrading. Those projects should re-approve Phase 1 after the author differentiates titles/ACs. Legacy already-approved artifacts are not re-validated retroactively.
- [ARTIFACTS.md](./ARTIFACTS.md) updated with the two new rules under "01_REQUIREMENTS.json — Validation rules".
- **Bump `INTEGRATION_LAST_REVIEWED`** to `0.1.82` after reviewing.

---

## v0.1.81

**`aitri status --json` — new top-level `tests` block (additive)**
- New `tests` object aggregates test counts across root + all feature sub-pipelines. Shape: `{ totals: { passed, failed, skipped, manual, total }, perPipeline: [{ scope, passed, failed, total, ran }], stalenessDays }`. See [STATUS_JSON.md](./STATUS_JSON.md#tests-v0181) for semantics.
- Each pipeline's own `verify.summary` is preserved unchanged — `tests` is an additive projection so consumers don't re-implement cross-pipeline aggregation.

**CLI text output — `Σ all pipelines` aggregate**
- `aitri status` and `aitri resume` now show a `Σ all pipelines` line with combined `passed/total` when at least one feature has a verify summary. Per-feature verify indicator now includes test counts: `verify ✅ (42/42)`.
- Closes the real-world gap where `aitri status` showed `30/30` for the root pipeline while features had ~256 additional tests invisible to the top-line view.

**Subproduct impact:**
- Purely additive — readers that ignore unknown JSON fields need no changes.
- Hub-style dashboards can now surface a global test-count without walking `features[]` and summing `verifyPassed` entries.
- **Bump `INTEGRATION_LAST_REVIEWED`** to `0.1.81` after reviewing.

---

## v0.1.80

**`aitri status --json` — new top-level `normalize` block (additive)**
- New `normalize` object exposes the off-pipeline change baseline plus a snapshot-time detection. Shape: `{ state, method, baseRef, uncountedFiles }`. See [STATUS_JSON.md](./STATUS_JSON.md#normalize) for semantics.
- `nextActions[]` priority 4 now also fires when `normalize.uncountedFiles > 0` (git baseline, resolved state) — same `aitri normalize` command, distinct reason text. Closes the gap where users who never ran `aitri normalize` got no nudge despite changing code outside the pipeline.

**`aitri approve` — informed human review (UX, no schema change)**
- Approval prompt now prints a per-phase artifact summary (FR/AC counts, TC breakdown, manifest stats, compliance levels, design sections) before the y/N gate. Non-TTY path (CI/agents) unchanged.

**Subproduct impact:**
- Purely additive — readers that ignore unknown JSON fields need no changes.
- Hub may surface `normalize.uncountedFiles > 0` in dashboards as an early signal of off-pipeline drift (complement to `health.driftPresent` which only covers approved-artifact drift).
- **Bump `INTEGRATION_LAST_REVIEWED`** to `0.1.80` after reviewing.

---

## v0.1.79

**`.aitri` schema — `verifyRanAt` and `auditLastAt` (additive)**
- `verifyRanAt` (ISO 8601 string) — written by every `aitri verify-run` invocation, regardless of pass/fail. Closes the gap left in v0.1.77 where `status --json health.staleVerify` was reserved-but-empty.
- `auditLastAt` (ISO 8601 string) — written by `aitri audit`. Replaces fragile `fs.statSync(AUDIT_REPORT.md).mtimeMs` for the staleness signal — file mtime resets when a project is freshly cloned, producing false "stale audit" signals. Snapshot still falls back to mtime when `auditLastAt` is absent (legacy projects).
- `verifyTimestamp` (set on `verify-complete` only, undocumented in earlier versions) removed — it was never read by any consumer and was superseded by `verifyRanAt` which is set on every run.

**`aitri status --json` — populated previously-reserved fields**
- `health.staleVerify` now lists pipelines whose persisted `verifyRanAt` is older than 14 days: `[ { "scope": "root | feature:<name>", "days": N } ]`. Empty when no pipeline has a `verifyRanAt` yet (legacy or never-verified projects), or when all are within the threshold.
- `tests.stalenessDays` (root pipeline) now returns an integer instead of always `null`. `null` only when the root has never run `verify-run` on v0.1.79+.
- `audit.lastAt` prefers persisted `auditLastAt`; falls back to file mtime only for legacy projects or audits written off-CLI.

**Subproduct impact:**
- **Hub and other remote consumers:** purely additive — readers that ignore unknown `.aitri` fields need no changes. If you previously surfaced "audit stale" using mtime, switch to `auditLastAt` when present and you'll stop getting false positives after fresh clones.
- **`status --json` consumers:** `health.staleVerify` now returns objects, not an empty array (its prior reserved shape). Treat as additive.
- **Bump `INTEGRATION_LAST_REVIEWED`** to `0.1.79` after reviewing.

---

## v0.1.77

**`aitri status --json` — unified project snapshot (new surface)**
- New CLI surface documented in [STATUS_JSON.md](./STATUS_JSON.md): `aitri status --json` emits an aggregated projection covering root + feature sub-pipelines, health signals, and a priority-ordered next-action list.
- Single source of truth for the CLI's `status`, `resume`, and `validate` commands — they are now thin projections over `buildProjectSnapshot()`.
- Legacy `status --json` fields preserved (`project`, `dir`, `phases`, `driftPhases`, `nextAction`, `allComplete`, `inHub`, `rejections`, `versionMismatch`, `aitriVersion`, `cliVersion`).
- New top-level fields: `snapshotVersion`, `features[]`, `bugs`, `backlog`, `audit`, `health`, `nextActions[]`.
- `health.deployable` + `health.deployableReasons[]` — deploy-gate reasoning now consistent across all three commands (previously `status` suggested `aitri validate` when phase 4 was approved without checking verify, while `resume` correctly gated on `verifyPassed`).

**`aitri validate --json` — additive fields**
- Added top-level `deployable`, `deployableReasons[]`, `openBugs`, `blockingBugs`. Existing fields (`artifacts[]`, `allValid`, `deployFiles`, `setupCommands`) unchanged.

**`aitri validate --explain` — new flag**
- Expanded text output that enumerates deploy-gate reasons (passing or blocking) inline.

**`aitri resume` — feature awareness**
- New `## Features` section lists each feature sub-pipeline with its progress, verify state, drift flag, and per-feature next action.
- New `## Health` section (shown when project has progress but is not deployable) enumerates blocking reasons.
- Next Action section now shows a priority-ordered list (up to 5 actions), not a single command.

**Subproduct impact:**
- **Hub and other remote (GitHub-URL) consumers:** no action required — the `.aitri` + artifact file contract is unchanged. `status --json` is additive and only reachable via the local CLI.
- **CLI-colocated consumers (IDE plugins, local dashboards):** may now consume `aitri status --json` directly instead of re-deriving aggregation logic from raw files. See [STATUS_JSON.md](./STATUS_JSON.md).
- **Bump `INTEGRATION_LAST_REVIEWED`** to `0.1.77` after reviewing changes. No reader changes required for remote consumers.

---

## v0.1.76

**`04_IMPLEMENTATION_MANIFEST.json` — `files_modified` field added**
- New optional field `files_modified: []` — list of existing files changed during implementation
- Gate changed: `files_created` OR `files_modified` must be non-empty (previously only `files_created`)
- Enables modification/redesign phases where no new files are created
- `files_created` is no longer a required field — omit if work only modified existing files

**Subproduct impact:** `04_IMPLEMENTATION_MANIFEST.json` may now have `files_modified` instead of (or in addition to) `files_created`. Readers should handle both fields.

---

## v0.1.74

**`aitri tc verify` — record manual TC execution results**
- New command: `aitri tc verify <TC-ID> --result pass|fail --notes "..."`
- Updates `04_TEST_RESULTS.json` in place: sets `status` to `pass|fail`, adds `verified_manually: true`, `verified_at` timestamp
- Manually verified TCs count toward `summary.passed` — total score reflects reality
- Syncs `.aitri` `verifySummary` so `aitri resume` shows updated numbers immediately
- `verify-run`: preserves `verified_manually: true` entries on re-run — manual verifications are not wiped by a subsequent automated test run
- New `summary.manual_verified` field: how many manual TCs have been recorded
- Display updated: `Manual: N/N verified` (was just `Manual: N`)

**Subproduct impact:** `04_TEST_RESULTS.json` now has `summary.manual_verified` and result entries may have `verified_manually: true` + `verified_at` fields. `summary.passed` now includes manually-verified passing TCs.

---

## v0.1.72

**`04_TEST_RESULTS.json` — manual TC support**
- New `status` value: `"manual"` — TCs with `automation: "manual"` in `03_TEST_CASES.json` are excluded from the automated runner gate; they receive `status: "manual"` instead of `"skip"`
- New `summary.manual` field: count of manual TCs in each run
- New `fr_coverage[].tests_manual` field: count of manual TCs per FR
- New `fr_coverage[].status` value: `"manual"` — for FRs whose TCs are all manual
- `verify-complete` no longer blocks on manual TCs: they are excluded from skip checks, notes requirements, and the "zero passing tests" gate
- `verify-run`: auto-detects `.venv/bin/pytest` (or `venv/bin/pytest`) if bare `pytest` command is used — fixes silent skip-all on Python virtualenv projects
- `verify-run` / `feature verify-run` / `feature verify-complete` added to `aitri feature` sub-commands

**Subproduct impact:** consumers of `04_TEST_RESULTS.json` should treat `"manual"` as a distinct status (not equivalent to `"skip"`). FR coverage `status: "manual"` means human-verified, not untested.

---

## v0.1.71

**`aitri audit` — on-demand code & architecture audit**
- New command: `aitri audit` generates an evaluative briefing; agent writes `AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- New sub-command: `aitri audit plan` reads `AUDIT_REPORT.md` and proposes Aitri actions (`bug add`, `backlog add`) for each finding
- New persona: `auditor` — meta-persona (not phase-bound, like `adopter`); evaluative, not generative
- New artifact: `AUDIT_REPORT.md` — optional, off-pipeline (three sections: Findings → Bugs, Findings → Backlog, Observations)
- No pipeline changes: AUDIT_REPORT.md does not affect validate, approve, or drift detection

---

## v0.1.70

**`.aitri` schema: `lastSession` field added**
- New optional field `lastSession` in `.aitri` — session checkpoint written automatically by `complete`, `approve`, `verify-run`, `verify-complete`, `feature init`, and `checkpoint`
- Schema: `{ at, agent, event, context?, files_touched? }`
- Agent auto-detected from environment variables (claude, codex, gemini, opencode, cursor)
- `aitri resume` now shows "Last Session" section with this data
- Subproducts can read `lastSession.at` for "last activity" and `lastSession.event` for "what happened last"

**Agent instruction files: multi-agent support**
- `aitri init` and `aitri adopt` now generate instruction files for multiple agents: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.codex/instructions.md`
- All files have identical content sourced from `templates/AGENTS.md`
- Non-destructive: never overwrites existing files

---

## v0.1.67

**`aitri bug` — first-class QA artifact (redesign from v0.1.66 prototype)**
- Bug artifact promoted from utility to first-class artifact with full schema formalization
- `BUGS.json` schema: `id, title, description, steps_to_reproduce[], expected_result, actual_result, environment, severity, status, fr, tc_reference, phase_detected, detected_by, evidence, reported_by, created_at, updated_at, resolution`
- Lifecycle: `open → fixed → verified → closed` (`in_progress` status removed)
- `detected_by`: `"manual"` | `"verify-run"` | `"playwright"` | `"review"`
- `reported_by`: `"aitri"` (auto) or arbitrary string from `--reported-by` flag
- Blocking rule: `status: "open"` + `severity: "critical"` or `"high"` blocks `verify-complete`
- Playwright evidence: auto-populated from `test-results/<folder>/screenshot.png` on TC failure

**No `.aitri` schema changes in v0.1.67.**

---

## v0.1.66

**New artifact: `BUGS.json`**
- New optional artifact in `<artifactsDir>/BUGS.json` (same dir as `spec/`).
- Written by `aitri bug add` (manual) or prompted by `aitri verify-run` on test failure.
- Schema: `id, title, description, steps_to_reproduce[], expected_result, actual_result, environment, severity, status, fr, tc_reference, phase_detected, detected_by, evidence, reported_by, created_at, updated_at, resolution`
- Lifecycle: `open → fixed → verified → closed`
- Blocking rule: `status=open` + `severity=critical|high` → blocks `verify-complete`
- Playwright integration: `evidence` auto-populated from `test-results/` on test failure
- Subproducts can read `BUGS.json` directly — not registered in `.aitri` state

**New commands (no `.aitri` schema change):**
- `aitri review` — cross-artifact semantic consistency check (req→TC, TC→results)
- `aitri bug` — full bug lifecycle with `add`, `fix`, `verify`, `close`, `list`
- `adopt verify-spec` — brownfield TC stub generator for existing codebases

**`verify-run` behavior change:**
- On test failure with TTY: prompts `Register as bugs? [y/N]` — auto-populates from runner output
- Playwright failures: `detected_by: "playwright"`, `evidence` from `test-results/` if available
- `autoVerifyBugs`: transitions `fixed → verified` when linked TC passes

**`.aitri` schema:** no new fields in v0.1.66.

---

## v0.1.64

**Breaking for subproducts relying on Aitri auto-registration:**
- `aitri init` and `aitri adopt --upgrade` no longer write to `~/.aitri-hub/projects.json`.
- Hub and other subproducts must manage their own project registries independently.
- Existing `~/.aitri-hub/projects.json` entries are unaffected; only new project creation stops auto-registering.

**New documentation:**
- `docs/integrations/` directory introduced as canonical integration contract.
- `docs/integrations/README.md` — integration model overview.
- `docs/integrations/SCHEMA.md` — consolidates and supersedes `docs/HUB_INTEGRATION.md`.
- `docs/integrations/ARTIFACTS.md` — artifact schemas including node hierarchy for graph consumers.
- `docs/integrations/CHANGELOG.md` — this file.
- `docs/HUB_INTEGRATION.md` — removed. Content migrated to `docs/integrations/SCHEMA.md`.

---

## v0.1.63

- `complete` now updates `artifactHashes` (previously only `approve` did).
  Hash check returns `false` after successful `complete` — no drift until next modification.
- `aitriVersion` field formalized. Version mismatch detection pattern documented.
- `verifyPassed`, `verifySummary`, `rejections` fields formally added to schema.
- Event schema updated: `"started"` added as valid event type; `afterDrift` on `"approved"` events.
- Feature sub-pipelines (`features/<name>/`) documented.

## v0.1.58

- `driftPhases[]` field added. Written by `run-phase` on drift; cleared by `complete`/`approve`.
- Subproducts can use `driftPhases[]` as fast path for drift detection.
- `driftPhases[]` may be absent in projects created before v0.1.58 — fall back to hash check.

## v0.1.51

- Document initial. Fields `artifactHashes`, `events`, `artifactsDir` formalized.
- Drift detection via hash comparison documented.
- Hub integration contract established.

## v0.1.46

- `aitri init` began auto-registering projects in Hub (removed in v0.1.64).

## v0.1.45

- `events[]` field added to schema (pipeline activity log).
