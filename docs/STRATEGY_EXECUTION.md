# Aitri: Execution Strategy

## Strategic Direction
Aitri should remain the practical SDLC operating layer for terminal-based AI coding workflows.

Priority order:
1. Discipline and reliability
2. Traceability and auditability
3. Agent portability and skill packaging
4. Supervised implementation/deployment assistance
5. Optional intelligence upgrades

## Execution Philosophy
- Governance before autonomy
- Determinism before complexity
- Reproducible CLI behavior before integrations
- Human supervision at every irreversible step

## Phase Status

### Phase A: Harden the Core
Status: COMPLETE
- docs/implementation/CI alignment complete
- persona model complete
- command contract stabilized
- discovery persona added and discover interview depth increased
- persona interaction boundaries documented to reduce role overlap

### Phase B: Validation Maturity
Status: COMPLETE (persona-gated baseline)
- FR -> US, FR -> TC, US -> TC checks
- machine-readable validation output
- typed gap reporting in JSON
- persona gates for Discovery/Product/Architect outputs

### Phase C: Agent Runtime Stability
Status: COMPLETE (baseline)
- non-interactive command mode
- consistent exit codes
- smoke tests in CI
- checkpoint/resume protocol documented for session continuity

### Phase D: Supervised Build/Deploy Assistance
Status: COMPLETE (baseline docs)
- runbook and templates defined
- human approval checkpoints documented

### Phase E: Skill Packaging and Distribution
Status: COMPLETE (baseline)
- adapter skills for Codex/Claude/OpenCode
- `agents/openai.yaml` metadata files
- packaging and install guide added
- zero-to-first-run onboarding guide added (global/project/skill)

### Phase F: Strategic Feedback Intake (February 2026)
Status: IN PROGRESS
- runtime verification loop delivered (`aitri verify`)
- brownfield mapping accepted (`aitri.config.json`)
- managed-go policy checks accepted (deterministic scan model)
- static insight UI accepted (`status --ui` + confidence score)
- scalable retrieval accepted as staged work (metadata first, optional semantic index later)

## Next Targets (v1.0.x)
1. Add brownfield semantic path mapping via `aitri.config.json`.
2. Introduce managed-go policy checks (dependency/policy drift detection).
3. Publish `status --ui` static insight view with confidence scoring model.
4. Deepen discovery-to-plan signal quality and reduce scaffold noise.
5. Split docs into default quick path vs advanced operations path.
6. Stage scalable retrieval for large contexts (section-level first, optional semantic index later).

Backlog source of truth:
- `backlog/aitri-core/backlog.md`

## Operating Metrics
- Workflow completion rate (`draft -> validate`)
- Validation failure categories (missing, placeholder, structure, coverage)
- Runtime verification pass rate and stale-verification rate
- Rework rate caused by specification gaps
- Workflow violations caught by gates

## Risk Register
- Scope inflation without discipline value
- Drift between docs and implementation
- Over-automation reducing human control
- Platform-specific behavior divergence across agents

## Decision Rule
If a proposal does not improve at least one of these, defer it:
- traceability
- reliability
- auditability
- controlled execution speed
