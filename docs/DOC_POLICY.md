# Documentation Policy

## Rule: Controlled Surface

The `docs/` directory has a hard file budget. Every file must have an owner and a purpose. Files without active readers are deleted, not archived.

## Permitted Files

| File | Purpose | Owner |
|------|---------|-------|
| `docs/MANIFESTO.md` | What Aitri is, design choices, honest scope | Permanent |
| `docs/architecture.md` | How Aitri works, command flow, artifact topology | Permanent |
| `docs/guides/GETTING_STARTED.md` | Install and first workflow (human + agent) | Permanent |
| `docs/guides/AGENT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` | Full agent workflow reference | Permanent |
| `docs/guides/SKILL_PACKAGING_AND_INSTALL.md` | How to package Aitri as an agent skill | Permanent |
| `docs/guides/FILE_GROWTH_POLICY.md` | Code file size budgets | Permanent |
| `docs/DOC_POLICY.md` | This file | Permanent |
| `docs/project.json` | Generated by Aitri commands | Generated |
| `docs/adoption-manifest.json` | Generated by `aitri adopt` | Generated |
| `docs/discovery/*.md` | Generated by `aitri discover` | Generated |
| `docs/plan/*.md` | Generated by `aitri plan` | Generated |
| `docs/verification/*.json` | Generated by `aitri verify` | Generated |
| `docs/delivery/*.json` | Generated by `aitri deliver` | Generated |
| `docs/implementation/**` | Generated by `aitri implement` | Generated |

## What Is NOT Permitted

- **Implementation design documents** (`PHASE_*_DESIGN.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md`).
  These are ephemeral planning artifacts. Write them in scratch space or in a PR description. Delete them when the work is done.

- **Session feedback files** (`docs/feedback/`).
  Feedback is processed into evolution backlog items (`backlog/aitri-core/evolution.md`) and then deleted.

- **Retrospective docs** (`VISION_ALIGNMENT.md`, `CHECKPOINT.md` equivalents).
  These become stale within one release cycle. Extract what is actionable into backlog or architecture, then delete.

- **Duplicate guides.** If information exists in two places, one is wrong. Merge and delete.

## Rules for New Files

1. **No new permanent doc without deleting one.** The total permanent file count must not grow unless the scope of Aitri genuinely expands.
2. **Every new doc must be listed in the table above.** Unlisted files are candidates for deletion at any time.
3. **Implementation design docs are ephemeral.** If you need one, name it `SCRATCH_*.md` or put it in a PR body. It is never committed to `docs/`.
4. **Session notes are not docs.** `.aitri/DEV_STATE.md` is the session state. It is not documentation.

## Rules for AI Agents

An AI agent working on Aitri must NOT:
- Create new `docs/` files without explicit user instruction
- Create `docs/feedback/` files (process feedback directly into `backlog/aitri-core/evolution.md`)
- Create `docs/architecture/` subdirectory files (design in code, document in `docs/architecture.md`)
- Duplicate information that already exists in another permitted file

## Enforcement

`aitri doctor` checks for unlisted files in `docs/` and warns. A CI gate can fail on undeclared permanent docs.

The permitted file list above is the contract. If a file is not on the list and is not in a Generated category, it should not exist.
