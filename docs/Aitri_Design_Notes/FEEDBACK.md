# Aitri — Testing Feedback

> **Purpose:** capture observations from testing sessions (manual or E2E with Claude).
> This is not a changelog or an implementation log — those go in CHANGELOG.md and BACKLOG.md.

> **Entry lifecycle:**
> observation → document here → analyze → move to BACKLOG.md (or discard) → **delete entry**
> If an entry stays here for more than one session without action, delete it anyway.

## Live entries

Entries below are observations from canary sessions whose action was deferred (not rejected, not shipped). Each stays only until it either matures into a BACKLOG item with real evidence, or is confirmed as not worth acting on.

### H4 — Canary setup friction: `cp -a` broken on Hub's `node_modules` (SEV: LOW, not Aitri)

Hub has `node_modules` with deeply nested symlink chains that `cp -a` refuses to copy (macOS `chflags: Too many levels of symbolic links`). Canary setup had to switch to `tar --exclude=node_modules`. Not Aitri's problem, but future canary runs against any Node project will hit this.

**Why kept:** candidate for a future convenience helper (`aitri adopt --upgrade --dry-run-to <path>` that does an in-place copy via `fs.cp` with the right flags). Design Study candidate, not urgent. Dry-run landed in v2.0.0-alpha.2 for in-place preview; a `--dry-run-to` variant would complement it only if multiple operators actually want to preview against a scratch copy.

**Reopen criterion:** a canary on a real project where in-place `--dry-run` is not safe enough.

## History

This file previously held ~270 lines of per-session observations (Ultron 2026-04-22 session A1–A6 + F1–F14; Hub 2026-04-24 session H1–H6). All shipped items landed in:

- **v0.1.90** — A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, F1, F2, F6, F12, F13 (individual fixes).
- **v2.0.0-alpha.1** — ADR-027 protocol redesign absorbing A1–A4 / F7 into the upgrade module; H1, H2 shipped as clean-project UX.
- **v2.0.0-alpha.2** — H3 (documented in SCHEMA.md + ADR-028), plus the three deferred items confronted in the 2026-04-24 review: `--dry-run` flag, `resume` brief default / F8, terminal-state next-action / F11.
- **v2.0.0-alpha.3** — H6 (third-project canary completed): Zombite ran cleanly, surfaced legacy hash drift class, resolved via new `aitri rehash` command (A5). Catalog of supported drift classes now covers modern schema drift, state backfills v0.1.65 → v0.1.82, and legacy hash bookkeeping.
- **v2.0.0-alpha.5** — H5 (verify ratio dissonance) shipped as three-bucket display `(P ✓ F ✗ D ⊘)` across status / resume / validate. H7 (rehash hint inside post-event "Re-approved After Drift" section) discarded — surface is post-hoc and rehash is a no-op there; the equivalent hint at fresh-drift time already lives in `approve` (A5b, alpha.3).

Items correctly rejected with rationale (F3 audit-quality honor system, F14 git boundary, etc.) are recorded in BACKLOG.md under "Discarded" or absorbed into ADR-027 addendum §5.

The full per-session notes are preserved in git history (pre-v2.0.0-alpha.2) — retrieve via `git log docs/Aitri_Design_Notes/FEEDBACK.md` when historical context is needed.
