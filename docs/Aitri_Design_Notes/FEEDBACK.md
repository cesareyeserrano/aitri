# Aitri — Testing Feedback

> **Purpose:** capture observations from testing sessions (manual or E2E with Claude).
> This is not a changelog or an implementation log — those go in CHANGELOG.md and BACKLOG.md.

> **Entry lifecycle:**
> observation → document here → analyze → move to BACKLOG.md (or discard) → **delete entry**
> If an entry stays here for more than one session without action, delete it anyway.

## Live entries

Entries below are observations from canary sessions whose action was deferred (not rejected, not shipped). Each stays only until it either matures into a BACKLOG item with real evidence, or is confirmed as not worth acting on.

### H4 — Canary setup friction: `cp -a` broken on Hub's `node_modules` (SEV: LOW, not Aitri)

Hub has `node_modules` with deeply nested symlink chains that `cp -a` refuses to copy (macOS `chflags: Too many levels of symbolic links`). Canary setup had to switch to `tar --exclude=node_modules`. Not Aitri's problem, but future canary runs against any Node project will hit this.

**Why kept:** candidate for a future convenience helper (`aitri adopt --upgrade --dry-run-to <path>` that does an in-place copy via `fs.cp` with the right flags). Design Study candidate, not urgent. Dry-run landed in v2.0.0-alpha.2 for in-place preview; a `--dry-run-to` variant would complement it only if multiple operators actually want to preview against a scratch copy.

**Reopen criterion:** a canary on a real project where in-place `--dry-run` is not safe enough.

### H5 — `aitri status` features list scales poorly on complex projects (SEV: LOW, tangential)

Hub has 9 sub-features, each listed as a full line in `aitri status`:
```
Features:
  hub-folder-scan      phases 5/5 verify ✅ (24/24)
  hub-mvp-web          phases 5/5 verify ✅ (37/53)
  ...
```

9 lines is manageable. 30 would flood the terminal. And ratios like `37/53` next to `✅` are ambiguous at a glance (passing tests vs "tests classified under this FR coverage" — actually the latter, but visual tension is real).

**Why kept:** pre-existing UX debt, separate from upgrade protocol.

**Reopen criterion:** first project with ≥20 features where the list becomes unreadable, OR agent confusion about the `N/M` ratio surfaces in a real session.

**Reconfirmation 2026-04-27 (alpha.4 canary on Hub).** The post-N1 canary on Hub re-surfaced the visual tension. Live output:
```
Σ  all pipelines  Aggregated  Passed (249/294)
hub-mvp-web                   verify ✅ (37/53)
integration-compat-manifest   verify ✅ (25/34)
```
`verify ✅ (37/53)` reads as a contradiction at a glance — `✅` suggests complete, `(37/53)` reads as 70%. The aggregated `(249/294)` (84%) labelled "Passed" has the same problem. The N is "tests with explicit FR coverage", M is "tests total", but the display does not say so.

**Severity escalation 2026-04-27 (alpha.4 canary on Zombite).** Zombite makes the dissonance much sharper. Live output:
```
Σ  all pipelines  Aggregated  Passed (17/66)
stabilizacion                 verify ✅ (2/51)
```
**4% (2/51) labelled with ✅** is jarring. A reader inspecting Zombite for the first time would reasonably conclude "verify ✅" is wrong or that the project is broken. The ratio is technically correct under the current semantics ("tests with explicit FR coverage"), but the visual contract is misleading enough that an honest skim produces a wrong mental model. Two canaries now confirm; on the worse one (Zombite) the tension is severe enough to justify cheap polish in alpha.5 rather than waiting for the original "≥20 features OR agent confusion" trigger. Suggested relabel: `tests N covered / M total` or move the ratio to a separate column with an explanatory header.

## History

This file previously held ~270 lines of per-session observations (Ultron 2026-04-22 session A1–A6 + F1–F14; Hub 2026-04-24 session H1–H6). All shipped items landed in:

- **v0.1.90** — A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, F1, F2, F6, F12, F13 (individual fixes).
- **v2.0.0-alpha.1** — ADR-027 protocol redesign absorbing A1–A4 / F7 into the upgrade module; H1, H2 shipped as clean-project UX.
- **v2.0.0-alpha.2** — H3 (documented in SCHEMA.md + ADR-028), plus the three deferred items confronted in the 2026-04-24 review: `--dry-run` flag, `resume` brief default / F8, terminal-state next-action / F11.
- **v2.0.0-alpha.3** — H6 (third-project canary completed): Zombite ran cleanly, surfaced legacy hash drift class, resolved via new `aitri rehash` command (A5). Catalog of supported drift classes now covers modern schema drift, state backfills v0.1.65 → v0.1.82, and legacy hash bookkeeping.

Items correctly rejected with rationale (F3 audit-quality honor system, F14 git boundary, etc.) are recorded in BACKLOG.md under "Discarded" or absorbed into ADR-027 addendum §5.

The full per-session notes are preserved in git history (pre-v2.0.0-alpha.2) — retrieve via `git log docs/Aitri_Design_Notes/FEEDBACK.md` when historical context is needed.
