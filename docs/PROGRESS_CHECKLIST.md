## 5) Operational Reliability
- [x] Smoke tests for core commands

## 10) Next Improvement Backlog
- [x] Brutal-feedback findings captured as actionable backlog
- [x] Prioritized epics and user stories documented

- [x] Explicit resume shortcut command implemented (`aitri resume`)
- [x] 5-minute reproducible demo path published
- [x] Runtime verification command implemented (`aitri verify`)
- [x] Handoff/go runtime verification gates implemented
- [x] Brownfield path mapping implemented (`aitri.config.json`)
- [x] Managed-go policy checks implemented (dependency/policy drift)
- [x] Static insight UI output available (`aitri status --ui`)
- [x] Confidence score model integrated into status output
- [x] Section-level staged retrieval implemented for discover/plan

## 11) Maintainability Growth Control
- [ ] Split `cli/index.js` into command-level modules with clear boundaries
- [ ] Split `tests/smoke/cli-smoke.test.mjs` into domain-focused smoke suites
- [ ] Define and enforce line-count budgets for core source/test files
- [ ] Add CI warning/block policy for files over growth thresholds
- [ ] Document file-growth dashboard/check report in contributor workflow
