# Aitri Docs: Index and Source of Truth

Use this folder as the official reference for product intent, governance, and execution.

## Recommended Reading Order
1. `docs/architecture.md` - product model, principles, operating contract
2. `docs/SCOPE_V1.md` - scope boundaries and Definition of Done
3. `docs/STRATEGY_EXECUTION.md` - strategy and evolution phases
4. `docs/AGENT_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` - runtime contract for agents
5. `docs/CHECKLIST_AVANCE.md` - closure checklist for ongoing tracking

## Purpose
Preserve continuity across time, contributors, and agent platforms.

If implementation and docs diverge, fix the divergence explicitly before continuing roadmap work.
