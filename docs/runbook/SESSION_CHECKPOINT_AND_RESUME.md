# Session Checkpoint and Resume Runbook

## Goal
Prevent loss of progress during abrupt interruptions and make cross-session continuation deterministic.

## Checkpoint Policy
Create a checkpoint at least after each major phase:
1. `draft`
2. `approve`
3. `discover`
4. `plan`
5. `validate`

Recommended command:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "checkpoint: <feature> <phase>"
```

If you cannot commit yet:
```bash
git stash push -m "checkpoint: <feature> <phase>"
```

## Resume Procedure (New Session)
From your target project:
```bash
aitri status json
```

Then execute the returned `nextStep`.

Typical mapping:
- `aitri init` -> structure missing
- `aitri draft` -> no approved spec
- `aitri discover` -> approved spec exists, discovery missing
- `aitri plan` -> discovery exists, plan missing
- `aitri validate` -> artifacts exist but validation pending/failing
- `ready_for_human_approval` -> artifacts and validation baseline complete

## Abrupt Shutdown Recovery
1. Re-open repository.
2. Run `git status --short`.
3. Recover stashed checkpoint if needed:
```bash
git stash list
git stash apply stash@{0}
```
4. Run `aitri status json`.
5. Continue with `nextStep`.

## Agent Behavior Requirement
Agents should:
1. Suggest a checkpoint before ending a substantial work block.
2. Start each new session with `aitri status json`.
3. Report detected state and next step before continuing.
