## Functional Coverage

### TC-1 — FR must be referenced by backlog
- Description: Validation fails if a Functional Rule (FR-*) in the approved spec is not referenced by any US-* in backlog.
- Trace: US-1, FR-1
- Steps:
  1. Create approved spec with FR-1 and FR-2.
  2. Reference only FR-1 in backlog.
  3. Run `aitri validate`.
- Expected Result:
  - Validation fails.
  - Output clearly reports FR-2 missing from backlog coverage.

### TC-2 — FR must be referenced by tests
- Description: Validation fails if a Functional Rule (FR-*) in the approved spec is not referenced by any TC-* in tests.
- Trace: US-2, FR-2
- Steps:
  1. Create approved spec with FR-1 and FR-2.
  2. Reference both FR-1 and FR-2 in backlog.
  3. Reference only FR-1 in tests.
  4. Run `aitri validate`.
- Expected Result:
  - Validation fails.
  - Output clearly reports FR-2 missing from test coverage.

### TC-3 — Validation passes with full coverage
- Description: Validation passes when all FR-* are referenced in backlog and tests.
- Trace: US-1, US-2, FR-1, FR-2
- Steps:
  1. Create approved spec with FR-1 and FR-2.
  2. Reference both FR-1 and FR-2 in backlog.
  3. Reference both FR-1 and FR-2 in tests.
  4. Run `aitri validate`.
- Expected Result:
  - Validation passes.
  - No missing coverage errors.

### TC-4 — Clear reporting of missing artifacts
- Description: Validation fails clearly when required artifacts are missing.
- Trace: US-4, FR-4
- Steps:
  1. Remove backlog or tests file.
  2. Run `aitri validate`.
- Expected Result:
