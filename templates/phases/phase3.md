> user_stories above include acceptance_criteria with Given/When/Then per AC id — use these to populate user_story_id, ac_id, and to write SPEC-SEALED test cases.
> no_go_zone above lists what is explicitly out of scope — do NOT write test cases for these items.

## System Design (architecture + API)
{{SYSTEM_DESIGN}}

## TC ID naming convention
- Happy-path TCs: suffix ID with `h` — e.g., `TC-001h: user logs in with valid credentials`
- Failure/negative TCs: suffix ID with `f` — e.g., `TC-001f: login rejected when password is wrong`
- Edge cases: any other suffix — e.g., `TC-001e`
- **Gate**: `aitri complete 3` requires every FR to have ≥1 TC id ending in `h` and ≥1 ending in `f`

## Output: `{{ARTIFACTS_BASE}}/03_TEST_CASES.json`
Schema:
{ test_plan: { strategy, coverage_goal: "80%", test_types: ["unit","integration","e2e"] },
  test_cases: [{
    id: "TC-001h",
    requirement_id: "FR-001",
    user_story_id: "US-001",
    ac_id: "AC-001",
    title: "Login — valid credentials returns JWT",
    type: "unit",
    scenario: "happy_path",
    priority: "high",
    preconditions: [],
    given: "user exists with email=test@example.com, password=Test1234!",
    when: "POST /auth/login { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'Test1234!' }",
    then: "response status 200, body contains { token: <JWT string>, expiresIn: 3600 }",
    steps: ["POST /auth/login with valid email + password"],
    expected_result: "Returns 200 + JWT token",
    test_data: {}
  }] }

## Given/When/Then — SPEC-SEALED rule
Every test case MUST include `given`, `when`, `then` fields with concrete, verifiable values.
"Concrete" means: actual values, HTTP status codes, field names, data structures — not abstract descriptions.

  ❌ given: "a valid user exists"            → ✅ given: "user with email=alice@example.com exists in DB"
  ❌ when: "user submits valid form data"     → ✅ when: "POST /register { email: 'alice@example.com', password: 'Pass1!' }"
  ❌ then: "user is registered successfully"  → ✅ then: "status 201, localStorage key 'userId' is set, redirect to /dashboard"
  ❌ given: "the app has data"               → ✅ given: "localStorage contains 3 movement entries totaling $120"
  ❌ then: "chart renders correctly"          → ✅ then: "canvas element visible, legend shows 3 categories, no console errors"

SPEC-SEALED: a test case where given/when/then contain abstract language is equivalent to no test case.

## Type Coverage Matrix
For each FR, declare which test levels are required before writing test cases:

  | FR     | Unit  | Integration | E2E   |
  |--------|-------|-------------|-------|
  | FR-001 | MUST  | SHOULD      | -     |
  | FR-002 | MUST  | -           | MUST  |

Rules:
  - MUST: this level is required for the FR to be considered tested
  - SHOULD: recommended but not blocking
  - -: not applicable for this FR type
  - FR type UX/visual/audio: E2E is always MUST
  - FR type persistence: Integration is always MUST (in-memory tests don't count)
  - FR type security: Unit AND Integration are both MUST
  - FR type logic: Unit is always MUST

Include the coverage matrix as `type_coverage_matrix` field in the JSON output.

## Schema contract — CRITICAL
- `requirement_id` MUST be a single FR id (e.g. "FR-001") — NEVER comma-separated ("FR-001,FR-002")
- `type` MUST be exactly one of: "unit" | "integration" | "e2e" — this is how aitri counts E2E tests
- `scenario` (separate field) is where you classify: "happy_path" | "edge_case" | "negative"
- `test_plan` is required — the artifact is invalid without it
- `given`, `when`, `then` are required fields — abstract values fail SPEC-SEALED rule

## Rules
- Every FR-* gets min 3 test cases: one happy_path, one edge_case, one negative
- Min 2 test cases with type "e2e" — each assigned to a single requirement_id
- Steps specific enough for a developer to implement directly
- E2E tests run via Playwright MUST follow the same TC-XXX: naming: test('TC-XXX: description', ...)
  This allows aitri verify-run --e2e to auto-detect them from Playwright output

## Mandatory gates by FR type (test LEVEL of implementation, not just presence)
- FR type UX:          must include test for responsive layout at 375px viewport AND visual component rendering
- FR type visual:      must include test at each breakpoint declared in acceptance_criteria (e.g. 375px, 768px, 1440px)
- FR type audio:       must include test that audio fires within the ms threshold declared in acceptance_criteria
- FR type persistence: must include test that data survives process restart — NOT in-memory/variable storage
- FR type security:    must include test that expired/invalid token returns 401 AND that protected route rejects unauthenticated request
- FR type reporting:   must include test that chart/graph component renders with real data (not placeholder/empty state)
- FR type logic:       must include boundary value test AND a test with production-scale data volume

## Fidelity rule — qualitative FRs (UX/visual/audio)
For every FR of type UX, visual, or audio: the expected_result of each test case MUST reference
the specific metric from that FR's acceptance_criteria — not just check presence.
  ❌ expected_result: "component renders"
  ✅ expected_result: "component renders at 375px viewport, animation completes in ≤200ms"
  ❌ expected_result: "audio plays"
  ✅ expected_result: "audio plays within 100ms of trigger with no gap on loop"
Copy the metric directly from the FR's acceptance_criteria into expected_result.

## Instructions
1. Build Type Coverage Matrix for all FRs
2. Write test cases with concrete Given/When/Then (SPEC-SEALED)
3. Generate complete 03_TEST_CASES.json
4. Save to: {{ARTIFACTS_BASE}}/03_TEST_CASES.json
5. Run: aitri complete 3

## Human Review — Before approving phase 3
  [ ] Every MUST FR has ≥3 test cases (happy path, edge case, negative)
  [ ] At least 2 e2e tests targeting critical user flows
  [ ] given/when/then use concrete values — no "valid data", "correct input", or abstractions
  [ ] user_story_id and ac_id in each TC reference real IDs from 01_REQUIREMENTS.json
  [ ] No test cases written for items declared in no_go_zone
  [ ] Type Coverage Matrix is present and FR types have correct required levels
  [ ] Every FR has at least one TC id ending in `h` (happy path) and one ending in `f` (failure)
