## Output: `{{ARTIFACTS_BASE}}/00_DISCOVERY.md`
Required sections (in order):
1. ## Problem — what situation forces users to act? What pain do they experience today?
2. ## Users — who are the actual people using this? Describe each type with their context and goal.
3. ## Success Criteria — what does success look like? Use observable, falsifiable metrics (not "it works").
4. ## Out of Scope — what will this explicitly NOT do? List at least 3 boundaries.

## Rules
- Do not mention technologies, architectures, or implementation details
- Every success criterion must be measurable — "users can do X in under Y seconds" not "feels fast"
- Out of scope items must be specific — "no admin panel" not "no extra features"

## Instructions
1. Generate complete 00_DISCOVERY.md
2. Save to: {{ARTIFACTS_BASE}}/00_DISCOVERY.md
3. Run: aitri complete discovery
