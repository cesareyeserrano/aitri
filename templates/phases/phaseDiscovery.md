## Interview Context — primary source
The following answers were provided directly by the project owner.
Treat them as primary source — synthesize the discovery from these answers, do not invent beyond them.
Where answers are vague, mark the gap in Evidence gaps.

## Ingest the context FIRST, then elicit what's missing
Discovery is not "fill in four headings." It is: **read what already exists → derive the understanding → confirm/ask only what the sources don't answer.**
- If the idea references context — an `## Assets` section, files in the `idea/` folder (listed below the briefing), a repo, a doc, mockups, a prior PRD — **READ them before writing anything.** Open the files, look at the mockups, read the docs. Derive Problem / Users / Success / Out-of-Scope from that material; do not re-ask what a provided doc already states.
- Mark in Evidence gaps anything the sources leave unclear, and confirm the three highest-stakes inputs with the owner (the problem, the success metric, the no-go boundaries) — those are unrecoverable if wrong.

## Match the depth to the project (proportional — do not over-process an MVP)
Scale discovery to what's being built:
- **Trivial / MVP** (a landing page, a small script, a one-screen tool): a tight pass is enough — a clear problem sentence, the user, one measurable success criterion, the obvious out-of-scope. Don't manufacture ceremony; confirm the essentials and hand off.
- **Standard / complex** (multi-flow app, integrations, an existing system to extend): full ingestion of the provided context plus real elicitation of the gaps.
The goal is an *honest* understanding sized to the work, not a fixed word count. A thin-but-correct discovery for a landing page is a success; a padded one is noise.

## Output: `{{ARTIFACTS_BASE}}/00_DISCOVERY.md`
Required sections (in order):
1. ## Problem — what situation forces users to act? What pain do they experience today?
2. ## Users — who are the actual people using this? Describe each type with their context and goal.
3. ## Success Criteria — what does success look like? Use observable, falsifiable metrics (not "it works").
4. ## Out of Scope — what will this explicitly NOT do? List at least 3 boundaries.
5. ## Discovery Confidence — required last section. Format exactly:

   ```
   ## Discovery Confidence
   Confidence: low | medium | high
   Evidence gaps: <bullet list of what is unclear, or "none">
   Handoff decision: ready | blocked — <one-line reason>
   ```

   Gate rules (enforced by `aitri {{SCOPE_VERB}}complete{{SCOPE_ARG}} discovery`):
   - `Confidence: low`           → BLOCKED — clarify evidence gaps before Phase 1
   - `Confidence: medium`        → WARNING — flag gaps to stakeholders, may proceed
   - `Confidence: high`          → PASS
   - `Handoff decision: blocked` → BLOCKED regardless of confidence level

## Rules
- Do not mention technologies, architectures, or implementation details
- Every success criterion must be measurable — "users can do X in under Y seconds" not "feels fast"
- Out of scope items must be specific — "no admin panel" not "no extra features"
- Set confidence honestly: low = critical unknowns remain; medium = minor gaps; high = all sections grounded in explicit user statements

## Instructions
1. Generate complete 00_DISCOVERY.md
