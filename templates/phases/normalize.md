## Your task

For each file listed above, read the actual code changes and classify the change using the spec artifacts above as reference.

### Step 1 — Classify each file

For each file, determine:

1. **What changed** — one sentence describing the behavior change (not the code change)
2. **Maps to existing FR?** — FR-XXX / none / partial
3. **Covered by existing TC?** — TC-XXX / none / partial
4. **Classification** — exactly one of:
   - `new-feature` — introduces behavior not covered by any existing FR
   - `fr-change` — modifies or extends behavior that an existing FR describes
   - `bug-fix` — restores behavior that an existing FR required but was broken
   - `refactor` — no observable behavior change (internal restructure, rename, extract)
   - `undetermined` — cannot classify without more context; state what is missing

### Step 2 — Output classification table

| File | What changed | FR | TC | Classification | Action |
|------|--------------|----|-----|---------------|--------|

### Step 3 — Propose Aitri commands

For every non-`refactor` entry, propose the exact command:

- `new-feature` → `aitri feature init <descriptive-name>`
- `fr-change` → `aitri run-phase requirements --feedback "<what changed and why>"`
  *(re-approving requirements will cascade and invalidate architecture, tests, and build)*
- `bug-fix` → `aitri bug add --title "<title>" --severity <critical|high|medium|low> --fr <FR-XXX>`
- `undetermined` → describe exactly what information is needed to classify

List commands in dependency order (bug fixes first, then fr-changes, then new features).

### Step 4 — Flag blockers

If any file cannot be classified, explain why and what the user must clarify before you can proceed.

Do not make assumptions about intent — ask.

### Step 5 — Close the cycle

After executing the proposed commands in Step 3, the warning in `aitri status` clears automatically in two cases:

- **Pipeline re-run path:** for any `fr-change` or `new-feature`, re-approving Phase 4 at the end of the re-run advances the baseline. No extra action needed — this happens automatically as part of `aitri approve build`.
- **Maintenance path:** if every entry is `refactor` or `bug-fix` that has been registered *and* verified in `BUGS.json`, the pipeline did not need spec changes. Run:

  ```
  aitri verify-run && aitri verify-complete
  aitri normalize --resolve
  ```

  `normalize --resolve` performs mechanical gates (tests passing, no open critical/high bugs) plus a human TTY confirmation, then advances the baseline to current HEAD without cascading Phase 5.

Do NOT use `--resolve` if any entry is `fr-change`, `new-feature`, or `undetermined`. Route those through the pipeline first.
