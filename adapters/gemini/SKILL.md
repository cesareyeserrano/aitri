# Aitri Skill (Gemini) — Spec-Driven SDLC

## Purpose
Use Aitri as the execution guardrail for spec-driven SDLC work with explicit human approvals. Optimized for Gemini's long context (1M tokens), allowing for deep project-wide traceability and multi-artifact analysis.

## Session Bootstrap (Mandatory)
1. Run `aitri resume` (or `aitri resume json` for machine-readable output)
2. If structure is missing (`nextStep: "aitri init"`), run `aitri init`
3. Re-run `aitri resume`
4. If checkpoint confirmation is requested, ask: "Checkpoint found. Continue from checkpoint? (yes/no)" and wait for explicit user decision.
5. Read `docs/README.md` and `docs/EXECUTION_GUARDRAILS.md` if present.
6. **Gemini Optimization:** Load and analyze all approved specs (`specs/approved/`) and the current project backlog into context to ensure cross-feature consistency.
7. Report state and next recommended step.

## Non-Negotiable Rules
1. Do not implement code before approved spec exists.
2. Never skip Aitri gate prompts.
3. Execute one command step at a time.
4. Use kebab-case feature names.
5. Keep changes minimal and traceable.
6. Do not invent requirements. Requirements/spec content must come from explicit user input.
7. If requirement details are missing, ask the user and stop advancement until clarified.
8. **Traceability:** Every code change must be traceable to a `TC-*` ID and a `US-*` ID.

## Aitri Commands

### Pre-Go (Governance and Planning)
- `aitri init`: Initialize project structure.
- `aitri draft [--guided]`: Create draft spec from idea.
- `aitri approve`: Validate and approve spec.
- `aitri discover [--guided]`: Generate discovery artifact.
- `aitri plan`: Generate plan, backlog (real stories), and tests (real cases) from spec.
- `aitri validate`: Verify traceability, coverage, and persona gates.
- `aitri verify`: Execute runtime verification.
- `aitri policy`: Run managed policy checks.
- `aitri status`: Show project and feature status.
- `aitri resume`: Resume session from last state.
- `aitri handoff`: Present handoff status.
- `aitri go`: Enter implementation mode (after human approval).

### Post-Go (Factory Execution)
- `aitri scaffold`: Generate project structure, executable test stubs, interface contracts.
- `aitri implement`: Generate ordered implementation briefs for AI agents.
- `aitri verify` (enhanced): Map test results to `TC-*`, report `FR`/`US` coverage.
- `aitri deliver`: Final delivery gate: all `FR`s covered, all `TC`s passing.

## Interactive Mode (Default)
Aitri commands are **interactive by default**. The agent should:
- Let Aitri prompt for confirmations naturally.
- Review each `PLAN` output before confirming.
- Never add `--non-interactive --yes` unless the user explicitly requests automation.
- Never suggest `--non-interactive --yes` by default in conversational sessions.

## CI/Pipeline Mode (Opt-in Only)
Only use these flags in CI pipelines or when the user explicitly requests unattended execution:
- `--non-interactive`: suppress prompts, fail if required args are missing.
- `--yes`: auto-confirm write operations.
- `--feature <name>`: pass feature explicitly.
- `json`, `-j`, or `--format json`: machine-readable output (`status`, `verify`, `policy`, `validate`).

## Default Workflow

### Pre-Go Phase
1. `aitri resume`
2. `aitri init` (when needed)
3. `aitri draft` -> Human review
4. `aitri approve`
5. `aitri discover`
6. `aitri plan`
7. Refine artifacts with personas (Architect, Developer, QA, etc.)
8. `aitri validate`
9. `aitri verify`
10. `aitri policy`
11. `aitri handoff`
12. Human GO/NO-GO decision
13. `aitri go`

### Post-Go Phase (Factory Execution)
14. `aitri scaffold`: generate project skeleton.
15. `aitri implement`: receive implementation briefs.
16. Implement each `US-*` brief in order from `IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md`.
17. After each `US-*`: `aitri verify` to confirm `TC-*` pass.
18. Repeat until all stories pass.
19. `aitri deliver`: final delivery gate.

## Gemini Context Management (1M tokens)
- **Deep Recall:** Leverage the long context to maintain awareness of all `AF-SPEC` files in `specs/approved/`.
- **Cross-Feature Impact:** When planning or implementing, check for potential conflicts or synergies with existing features documented in the specs.
- **SDD Integrity:** Use the context to ensure that every `FR-*` defined in the spec is correctly mapped to a `US-*` and verified by a `TC-*`.

## Persona Alignment
Use iterative persona lenses:
- Architect, Developer, QA, Security, UX/UI, Discovery, Product.
- Re-run relevant personas after any material change.

## Approval Behavior
If Aitri outputs `PLAN` and requests `Proceed? (y/n)`:
1. Summarize the plan.
2. Ask for explicit approval.
3. Execute only after approval.

## Checkpoint Behavior
Write commands create auto-checkpoints (max: 10).
At the end of substantial progress, manual fallback:
- `git add -A && git commit -m "checkpoint: <feature> <phase>"`

## Exit Codes
- `0`: success
- `1`: error
- `2`: user-aborted action
