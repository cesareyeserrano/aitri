# Aitri Skill (Codex) — Spec-Driven SDLC

## Purpose
Use Aitri as the workflow guardrail to move from idea to validated SDLC artifacts, and only then proceed to implementation with explicit human approval.

Aitri execution model:
- Human decides and approves
- Aitri enforces structure and traceability
- Agent executes within Aitri constraints

## Session Bootstrap (Mandatory)
1. Read `docs/README.md`
2. Read `docs/EXECUTION_GUARDRAILS.md`
3. Run `aitri status --json`
4. Report current state and next recommended step

## Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)
1. No code implementation before approved spec.
2. Never bypass Aitri gate prompts.
3. One command step at a time.
4. Use kebab-case feature names.
5. Keep output deterministic and minimal.

## Commands
- `aitri init`
- `aitri draft [--guided]`
- `aitri approve`
- `aitri discover`
- `aitri plan`
- `aitri validate`
- `aitri status`

## CI/Agent Mode
For non-interactive execution:
- Use `--non-interactive`
- For write commands (`init`, `draft`, `approve`, `discover`, `plan`) also use `--yes`
- Pass feature explicitly where needed: `--feature <name>`
- Use `--json` for machine-readable output (`status`, `validate`)

## Recommended Workflow
1. `aitri status --json`
2. `aitri init` (if structure missing)
3. `aitri draft`
4. Human review of draft
5. `aitri approve`
6. `aitri discover`
7. `aitri plan`
8. Refine artifacts with personas
9. `aitri validate`
10. Human approval before implementation/deployment assistance

## Persona Usage
When refining artifacts, apply:
- Product
- Architect
- Developer
- QA
- Security
- UX/UI (if user-facing)

Reference files:
- `core/personas/product.md`
- `core/personas/architect.md`
- `core/personas/developer.md`
- `core/personas/qa.md`
- `core/personas/security.md`
- `core/personas/ux-ui.md`

## Approval Behavior
If Aitri shows `PLAN` + `Proceed? (y/n)`:
1. Stop
2. Summarize plan
3. Ask for human approval
4. Proceed only on explicit approval

## Exit Codes
- `0`: success
- `1`: error
- `2`: user-aborted action
