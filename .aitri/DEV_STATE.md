## 🎯 Current Objective
[EVO-META] Self-Evolution System Implementation.
- We have created `docs/guides/SELF_EVOLUTION.md`.
- We have initialized `backlog/aitri-core/evolution.md` with prioritized feedback.

## 🧠 Working Memory (Context)
- Implemented EVO-005: Relaxed TC marker regex in tc-scanner.js. Verified with smoke tests.

## 🚧 Active State
- [x] Docs: `docs/guides/SELF_EVOLUTION.md` created.
- [x] Backlog: `backlog/aitri-core/evolution.md` initialized.
- [ ] Code: Implement `aitri checkpoint` command (or hook).

## 🛑 Blockers / Errors
None.

## ⏭️ Next Immediate Action
Ask the user to confirm if they want me to proceed with implementing the `aitri checkpoint` command in `cli/commands/checkpoint.js` to automate this manual process.
