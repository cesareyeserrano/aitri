## 🚧 Active State
- [x] Docs: `docs/guides/SELF_EVOLUTION.md` created.
- [x] Backlog: `backlog/aitri-core/evolution.md` initialized.

## ⏭️ Next Immediate Action
Ask the user to confirm if they want me to proceed with implementing the `aitri checkpoint` command in `cli/commands/checkpoint.js` to automate this manual process.
