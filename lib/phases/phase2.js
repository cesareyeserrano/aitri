      `1. Executive Summary — tech choices with justification`,
      `2. System Architecture — ASCII/Mermaid diagram + components`,
      `3. Data Model — ER diagram + schema with indexes`,

      `For each critical component (database, auth layer, external APIs, background jobs), document:`,
      `  - What breaks if this component fails`,
      `  - What the user sees (error message, blank screen, stale data, etc.)`,
      `  - Recovery path (retry, fallback, manual intervention)`,

      `  Component: <name>`,

      `  Recovery: <how system recovers>`,
      `\n## Traceability Checklist`,
      `Before completing this phase, verify:`,
      `  [ ] Every FR-* in requirements is addressed by at least one component`,
      `  [ ] Every NFR-* has a corresponding design decision (caching, rate limiting, TLS, etc.)`,
      `  [ ] Every ADR has ≥2 options`,
      `  [ ] no_go_zone items from Phase 1 are not present in the architecture`,
      `  [ ] Failure blast radius documented for ≥2 critical components`,
      `\n## Rules`,
      `- Every FR-* and NFR-* must be addressed`,
      `- All tech choices must be justified with specific versions`,
      `- Honor the no_go_zone from 01_REQUIREMENTS.json — do not introduce components that were declared out of scope`,
      `\n## Instructions`,
      `1. Write ADRs for all major tech decisions (≥2 options each)`,
      `2. Document failure blast radius for critical components`,
      `3. Verify traceability checklist before saving`,
      `4. Generate complete 02_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`,
      `5. Save to: ${dir}/02_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`,
      `6. Run: aitri complete 2`,
